# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Author: Jay Raval <br />
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
A full description of the Data is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Goal of the Project
1. Generate a tidy data set 
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script
